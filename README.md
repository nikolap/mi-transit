# MI-Transit

Production: https://mi-transit.vercel.app/

## Goals

Project is time boxed to 3h.

Have a working Swiss transit search app running and integrated with CI/CD using
the [transport.opendata.ch API](https://transport.opendata.ch/docs.html).

## Development Environment

### Requirements

You will require the following to get started:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/), v18 recommend, works with v16

### Setup

Clone the project from Github

    git clone git@github.com:nikolap/mi-transit.git

And run it by first installing dependencies

    npm install

then running the local server

    npm run dev

### Developing

During development you can run the [jest](https://jestjs.io/) test watcher via

    npm run test

This process will watch for changes to your source files or tests and automatically re-run them.

The project has Github branch protection rules enabled on the production branch (`main`). The rules require you create a
pull request and have your changes merged in that form.

This project uses [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and enforces them via a
pre-commit hook setup via [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky). The pre-commit hook is automatically set up
on `npm install` via `prepare`.
